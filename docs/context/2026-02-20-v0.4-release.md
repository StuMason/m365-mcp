# v0.4.0 Release

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Commit:** a97911f

## What changed

Version bump to v0.4.0 in `package.json` and the MCP server declaration in `index.ts`.

## Why

Cutting a release that bundles all changes since v0.2.0:

1. **Recurring meeting transcript fix** — transcripts now match to specific calendar event occurrences by `createdDateTime`, with caching per meeting ID.
2. **Mail search fix** — `$orderBy` dropped when `$search` is present (Graph API does not support combining them).
3. **Paginated transcript drill-down** — returns 10k char chunks with clear continuation instructions instead of dumping entire transcripts into LLM context.
4. **`ms_server_info` tool** — debug/meta endpoint showing version, tools list, env var status, runtime info. No auth required.
5. **Test improvements** — mocked `child_process` so `openBrowser` tests don't launch real browser tabs; 170 tests, 92.8% coverage.

## Context

- v0.3.0 was skipped — the scope of changes warranted v0.4.0.
- The transcript pagination default (10k chars, max 50k) was chosen to balance LLM context preservation with useful content per call.
